It's been a while since I watched the last John Fish's video. Always love his lifestyle, he inspired me a lot about a minimalism lifestyle as a Havard student.

This video is about how important is taking enough 8-9 hours of sleeping. That improve productivity so much. So don't think sleepping is wasting time.
