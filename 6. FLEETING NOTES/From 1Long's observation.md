I realized something after using 1Long (to save money) about business stuff. From my personal view - as a customer:
- **They give customers what they need**: As a customer, I want to earn more money from passive income, I chose 1Long because the higher interest rate than other banking apps. Without too much finance knowledge, without spending too much time in learning finance.
- So then I can focus on my strength in my job.
- They public they way they made money by investing in many things (stock, bond, real estate, etc) -> this makes users believe more...
- They put a target on user, where they want to achieve the [[financial freedom|Financial Freedom]]. Actually this is a trend in our generation (Gen-Y, Gen-Z).
- And they are planning to build a set of truthworthy customers (khách hàng trung thành).
