# What I'm doing here?

I am currently a Junior Frontend Developer at Sky Mavis. Although majoring in Data Science, I find myself obsessed with frontend journey.

This page is the MOC, and a place to mark my frontend journey as I'm going through with it. Hopefully, this journey will take me to a promise land.
