# 1. Pre-reading

## 1.1. Why do I want to read this book?

This book is recommended by [Ali Abdal](https://www.youtube.com/@aliabdaal), a youtuber that creates productivity content that I admire a lot. There are a lot of things setting me back lately, from personal stuffs, to works. And I know that this is the time for me to change, not any time later, but now. And this book will help me to do it.

## 1.2. What do I expect to obtain from this book?

I expect that I should have a clear view about productivity. As the title said, how to "Get more done in 12 weeks than others do in 12 months". I should be more productive and be able to perform at my best.

# 2. Reading

## Chapter 1 - The challenge

> [!quote] Quote
> "It's not what you know; it's not even who you know; it's what you implement that counts."

> [!faq]- What is the thing setting you back from your desire life style?
> The barrier standing between you and the life you are capable of living is a lack of consistent execution. Execution is the single greatest market differentiator. It is the path to accomplish things you desire.
> 
> **Great ideas are worthless unless they are implemented.**

## Chapter 2 - Redefining the year

> [!faq]- What is annualized thinking?
> Annualized thinking is when people evaluate their success annually. Therefore, this make you lack a sense of urgency and forget one important thing.
> 
> **Effective execution happens daily and weekly!**

> [!tip]- How breakthrough is made?
> When you focus on changing your actions, you experience incremental improve-ments; however, when your thinkings shifts - everything changes. Your actions naturally realign with your new thought patterns.
>
> This is how break throughs are created.

> [!faq]- Why are people so productive on 31 December?
> On this day, they will measure their success or failure, and this day marks the end of the calendar. This date is actually immaterial, this is just a timestamp where the game ends and success or failure is proclaimed.

> [!faq]- How 12 Week Year makes every day becomes important?
> 12 Week Year creates a new endgame date for you by every 12 weeks instead of 12 months. That makes the deadline always near enough that you nerver lose sight of it.
> 
> It also forces you to confront your lack of execution. Since you can only have 12 Weeks in a year, how can you have 1 or 2 weeks that considered bad? This make every day of the week automatically becomes more important.

## Chapter 3 - The emotional connection

> [!quote] Quote
> A compelling personal vision creates passion.

> [!quote] Quote
> Business objectives are not the end in themselves, but the means to an end.

> [!faq]- Why do you have to sacrifice your comfort for best execution?
> Because important actions are often the uncomfortable ones. Therefore, in order to achieve what you are capable of, the number-one thing that you will have to sacrifice is your comfort.

> [!faq]- What do you need in order to be great?
> In order to perform at your best, you will need to have a compelling vision. To out-perform your past-self, you need to have a vision of the fure that is begger than the present.
> 
> **Vision is the starting point of all high performance**. The biggest barrier to high performance is not the physical manifestation but the mental creation. You will never outpace your mental models.

> [!tip]- Why personal vision is important?
> The more personally compelling your vision is, the more likely you will act upon it. Your personal vision will create an emotional connection to the daily actions you take in order to be great.

> [!faq]- Why are there so many people fail when things get tough?
> Business vision is most powerful when it is developed in light of personal vision. Therefore, the lack of connection with personal lives make many people fail to follow through when things become difficult.

> [!faq]- Why do we stop before doing anything detrimental?
> A portion of the brain, the **amygdala**, reacts negatively when facing uncertainty and risk. This response is helpful when avoiding danger and staying alive. However, when you start to envision a future that stretches your comfort zone, amygdala tries to shutdown the process before you do anything that could be **detrimental**.

> [!faq]- How does the brain counterbalance amygdala?
> A portion of your brain, called the **prefrontal cortex (PFC)**, acts as a counterbalance to the amygdala. It lights up when you imagine greatness for yourself in the future.

> [!info]- Discovers about our brains
> Our brains have a powerful capacity to change, this mean that **brain can change overtime**. The areas that we use frequently actually grow in the density of **neural connections** and in size.
> 
> This capacity for our brains to change is called **neuroplasticity**. And it changes based on how you use it.

> [!tip]- How to defeat amygdala?
> Unless you intentionally engage the PFC, you are by default, *strengthening the amygdala*. Thankfully, you can change your brain simply by what you think about. By thinking repeatedly and regularly about your compelling future for yourself, you can strengthen and develop your brain.
> 
> When you think about a compelling vision, ==the neurons that fire in your brain are the same neurons that fire when you act on your vision==. Which mean you can train your brain to act on your vision by thinking about it.

## Chapter 4 - Throw out the annual plan

> [!quote] Quote
> "A vision without a plan is a pipe dream."

> [!faq]- Why do we need to have a plan after having a clear vision?
> Imigine driving accress country on a family vacation without a map, that is the main idea of not having a plan after having a clear vision.
> 
> ==Having a plan to achieve your vision and your professional goal is vital.==

> [!faq]- What are the three benefits of planning?
> 1. It reduces mistakes: you make mistakes on paper, not during implementations.
> 2. It saves time.
> 3. It provides focus.

> [!faq]- What are the benefits of 12 week planning?
> 12 week planning offers three additional and distinct differences from annual planning:
> 1. More predictable.
> 2. More focused.
> 3. More structured.

> [!faq]- Why 12 week planning is more predictable?
> ==The farther you plan into the future, the less predictability you have==. With long-term plans such as annual plans, assumptions are stacked upon assumptions, making it biased.
> 
> Therefore, with 12 week plan, you can define with a high degree of certainty, what actions you need to take for each week, or each day.

> [!faq]- Why 12 week planning is more focused?
> Annual planning has too much to care about since you're preparing for a whole year. Contradictory, 12 week planning focuses on top 3 things and you will pursue it with intensity, every moment will be valueable. And this will make you focus on the things lead to your goal.

> [!faq]- Why 12 week planning is more structured?
> Like the idea from why it is more focused and more predictable, you are planning less, which makes your plan becomes more structured. And instead of just listing the goal without any tactics to achieve that goal, 12 week planning makes you to sketch out all the things you need to do in order to achieve your goal.

> [!faq]- What is the point of planning?
> The whole point of planning is to help you identify and implement critical *few* actions that you need to take in order to achieve your goal. ==The way the plan is structured and how it is written impacts your ability to effectively execute==.

> [!faq]- What do you need to do after having a goal?
> Writing or breaking down your goal into tactics is the first thing you need to do. Tactics are the *daily to-do's* which drive your success. Having a good tactics means that you will always have google map around you.

## Chapter 5 - One week at a time

> [!quote] Quote
> "Long-term results are created by the actions you take every day."

> [!faq]- Why is it so important to construct plans that are not only number based but also need to have specific, critical activity?
> Because your results are created by your actions, and you have a greater control over your action that you do your results.

> [!faq]- What are the means to get what you want in life?
> Consistent action on the critical tasks needed to reach your goal is the key to getting what you want in life. It's just not enough to only have the intention of changing; you also have to *act* on that intention.

> [!faq]- How to know what your future looks like?
> Your current action is creating your future. Then if you want to predict your future, look to your actions, they are the best predictor of your future.

> [!faq]- Why weekly plan is a powerful tool?
