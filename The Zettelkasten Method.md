## Parts of a zettelkasten note

<div class="center"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/MAjSvBK.png" /></div>

### 1. A unique identifier

This is nothing but a unique identifier for each note. In obsidian, I use the note's title.

### 2. Body

This is the main part of the note.

The most important thing of this body part is that it is written in my own words. Even a literature note, I need to summary, and write it in my own thoughts ([[The Active Recall Method]]).

### 3. Footer/References

A note should be linked to another note. Memory is thoughsands of knowledge linked together.

So make links as smart as possible. Why? Because you should not create so many notes, that's wasting of your time and effort if the note is not knowledge (just information).

## Connecting Zettel

Emphasize the important of connecting Zettel notes.

There's some advantages:
- This improves my mind, imagination and train my mind to recognize pattern
- Enrich knowledge for both notes
